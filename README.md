About Compilation Toolbox
==========================
Dynamic code generation is ability to generate Java classes at runtime and loading them and access in the same way as ordinary compiled Java Classes. This could be achieved either by using byte-code generation libraries like Apache BCEL, asm, cglib, javaassist or by using java compilation api (javax.tools). This library uses the latter approach providing comprehensive api to both compiling and loading dynamically generated classes.
